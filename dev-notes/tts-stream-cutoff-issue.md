# TTS Stream Audio Cutoff Issue

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Observed on:** Foamology session (researching company, 5 subagents launched)
**Priority:** Next sprint item

## What Happened (Plain English)

The user asked the AI to research Foamology. The AI responded with a list of 5 things it was going to research. Instead of hearing that as smooth speech, the user heard choppy, cut-off audio — like someone rapidly starting and stopping a recording.

Here's why: When the AI streams a response, the app breaks it into sentences and sends each sentence to the voice engine (Groq) separately. The problem is it sends ALL sentences at the same time — so 5 audio clips come back almost simultaneously. The audio player is supposed to queue them and play one after another, but they arrive so fast that they pile up and step on each other.

Think of it like 5 people trying to talk through the same walkie-talkie at once. Each one starts talking before the last one finishes. The app has a queue system that should prevent this (like a "wait your turn" line), but it's not working reliably — probably because some of the audio clips are so short or arrive so fast that the browser can't keep up.

There are three settings in the app config that were designed to fix this, but none of them are actually connected to the code yet. They're just placeholder settings that do nothing. See `unwired-tts-config-options.md` for details on those.

## Technical Details

### Symptom
When LLM streams a long response, TTS audio chunks play rapidly and cut each other off instead of playing as smooth sequential speech.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Backend Flow (routes/conversation.py)
1. LLM streams token-by-token via OpenClaw gateway
2. Tokens accumulate in `_tts_buf`
3. `_extract_sentence()` splits on `.!?` with min 40 chars (hardcoded, ignores profile `min_sentence_chars`)
4. Each complete sentence fires `_fire_tts()` in a **background thread** — all TTS runs in parallel
5. Audio chunks are **yielded sequentially** to the client (waits for each thread in order)
6. Client receives NDJSON with `{"type": "audio", "audio": "<base64>", "chunk": N}`

### Frontend Flow (src/providers/TTSPlayer.js)
1. `TTSPlayer` has a queue-based player: `audioQueue[]`, `currentAudio`, `isPlaying`
2. `queue(base64Audio)` creates an `Audio` element with `onended → _playNext()`
3. `_playNext()` shifts from queue, plays next — should be sequential
4. VoiceSession.js line 326: `this.tts.queue(data.audio)` on each chunk

### The Problem
The queue implementation looks correct on paper, but audio chunks arrive very fast from backend (all TTS fired in parallel, ~130-200ms Groq latency). Possible issues:
- **Browser `onended` unreliability** on very short audio clips
- **Race condition**: chunks arrive faster than `onended` fires, new `queue()` call might interfere
- **No gap between chunks**: no silence between sentences makes it sound like cutoff even when sequential
- **Backend ordering**: parallel TTS threads may complete out of order vs yield order

## Config Options (exist in schema but NOT implemented)

| Config | Default | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `parallel_sentences` | `true` | NOT IMPLEMENTED — always parallel |
| `min_sentence_chars` | `40` | HARDCODED in `_extract_sentence()`, ignores profile value |
| `inter_sentence_gap_ms` | `null` | NOT IMPLEMENTED — no silence between chunks |

## Key Files

**Backend:**
- `routes/conversation.py` lines 643-878 — sentence extraction, TTS firing, audio yielding
- `services/tts.py` lines 103-114 — sentence splitting in `generate_tts_chunked`
- `profiles/manager.py` lines 56-62 — VoiceConfig defaults (was supertonic/M1, now groq/autumn)

**Frontend:**
- `src/providers/TTSPlayer.js` — queue-based audio player (queue/playNext/stop)
- `src/core/VoiceSession.js` line 326 — queuing audio from stream

## Proposed Fix Direction (DO NOT IMPLEMENT YET)

1. **Frontend: harden the audio queue**
   - Use `AudioContext` instead of `new Audio()` for more reliable playback control
   - Add explicit gap between chunks (respect `inter_sentence_gap_ms`)
   - Add `oncanplaythrough` before attempting play
   - Consider pre-buffering: wait for N chunks before starting playback

2. **Backend: respect profile config**
   - Read `min_sentence_chars` from profile instead of hardcoded 40
   - Implement `parallel_sentences: false` option for sequential TTS
   - Consider coalescing short sentences before TTS dispatch

3. **Backend: smarter sentence batching**
   - Instead of 1 sentence = 1 TTS call, batch 2-3 short sentences together
   - Reduces number of audio chunks client needs to manage
   - Reduces Groq API calls
